[[Heap]]

- `KthLargest(int k, int[] nums)` Initializes the object with the integer `k` and the stream of test scores `nums`.
- `int add(int val)` Adds a new test score `val` to the stream and returns the element representing the `kth` largest element in the pool of test scores so far.

```python

import heapq
class KthLargest:

    def __init__(self, k: int, nums: List[int]):
        self.minHeap,self.k=nums,k
        heapq.heapify(self.minHeap)
        while len(self.minHeap)>k:
            heapq.heappop(self.minHeap)
        
        

    def add(self, val: int) -> int:
        heapq.heappush(self.minHeap,val)
        if len(self.minHeap)>self.k:
            heapq.heappop(self.minHeap)
        return self.minHeap[0]


# Your KthLargest object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = KthLargest(k, nums)
# param_1 = obj.add(val)
```

## What are we doing

- first we recieves a nums
- we only stores the k [any number] amount of largest elements ,
- we remove others by using loop

- On adding we adds the element in the minHeap accordingly
- Then we remove the smallest number in that list
- then we  have again k amount of elements , and on [0 ],acc to minHeap has smallest number out of those
-  And we need the kth amount of largest element .

All we are trying to is  Store a list of just k amount of lists and using minHeap to return the smallest element out of that


Like trying to fiind always the 70th highest score from the exams scores
-we adds scores and when new score added ,return the 70th smallest score
